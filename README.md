# article-preview-component
rough attempt at article preview component challenge.

questions:
1. github pages is showing different CSS formating than when I copy full path directly from Atom...why?
2. can you include images, icons, or links in tippy? I tried a bunch of different ways, but it always ends up showing up as the full HTML text.
3. jQuery threw me for a loop here, I am brand new to it and gave it an attempt. What I want to happen, is when the button hover state is true, and the screen size less than 840px is true, then it runs a function that changes the layout (hiding the name and profile pic, and putting up a dark div, and includes social icons.
